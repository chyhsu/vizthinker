# 🚀 VizThinker Dynamic IP Deployment - Quick Start

## 📖 Overview

The new deployment system supports deploying VizThinker to any IP address, eliminating the need for hardcoded server addresses.

## ⚡ Quick Deployment

### Step 1: Preparation
```bash
cd /home/jemmy/vizthinker
```

### Step 2: Run the Deployment Script
```bash
./deploy/deploy.sh
```

The system will prompt you to enter the target IP address:
```
🎯 VizThinker Deployment Script
======================
Please enter the server IP address for deployment:
IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100): 
```

Enter your target IP address, for example: `192.168.1.100`

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment to Complete
The script will automatically:
- Generate configuration files tailored to your IP
- Install and configure all dependencies
- Build frontend and backend applications
- Start all services

## 🎯 Command Line Quick Deployment

If you know the target IP address, you can specify it directly:

```bash
./deploy/deploy.sh 192.168.1.100
```

## 🧪 Test Deployment

### Automatic Testing
```bash
./deploy/test-deployment.sh
```

### Specify IP for Testing
```bash
./deploy/test-deployment.sh 192.168.1.100
```

## 🌐 Access the Application

After successful deployment, access the application in your browser:

- **Frontend**: http://your-ip-address
- **Backend API**: http://your-ip-address:8000

For example, if your IP is `192.168.1.100`:
- Frontend: http://192.168.1.100
- Backend: http://192.168.1.100:8000

## 🔄 Change Deployment IP

If you need to change the deployment IP address:

```bash
# Rerun the deployment script and enter the new IP address
./deploy/deploy.sh

# Or specify the new IP directly
./deploy/deploy.sh 192.168.1.200
```

All configuration files will be automatically regenerated and applied with the new IP address.

## 📋 Supported Environments

- ✅ Local Network (192.168.x.x)
- ✅ Public IP
- ✅ Cloud Servers
- ✅ Virtual Machines

## ⚠️ Notes

1. **Firewall**: Ensure the target server allows access to ports 80 and 8000
2. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure the target IP address is accessible from the client
3. **Permissions**: Running the deployment script requires sudo privileges
4. **Configuration Overwrite**: Configuration files are regenerated each time the deployment script is run

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: IP Address Format Error
```
❌ Error: Invalid IP address format
```
**Solution**: Ensure the IP format is xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

### Issue 2: Cannot Access Frontend
**Check**:
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
curl http://your-ip-address
```

### Issue 3: Cannot Access Backend API
**Check**:
```bash
sudo systemctl status vizthinker-backend
curl http://your-ip-address:8000/health
```
